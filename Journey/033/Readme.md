# Linux Cloud Engineer Bootcamp - Week 2

## Introduction

Week 2 started with Mike going through the steps to create a Linux VM in an AWS EC2 instance and similar to Day 1, installing a WebServer and then scripting that installation into a reusable bash script that can be deployed during VM creation.

I then got my first look at Google Cloud Platform, when Robin Smorenburg gave us a walkthrough of the GCP Portal, and the process to create a Linux VM on GCP both in the Portal and Google Cloud Shell.
