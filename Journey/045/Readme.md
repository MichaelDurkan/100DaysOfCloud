# Azure Spot and Reserved Instances

## Introduction

Azure Spot instances allow you to utilize any unused Azure Capacity in your region at the fraction of the cost. However, at any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Spot Instances will be evicted and removed from service at 30 seconds notice.

Azure Reserved Instances is a way to reserve your compute capacity for a period of 1, 3 or 5 years at savings of over 70% when compared to Pay-As-You-Go pricing. This is best suited to Production workloads that need to have 24/7 runtime and high availability.
