# Azure Network Adapter

## Introduction

Azure Network Adapter is a way to set up connectivity from on-premise servers running Windows Server 2019 directly into the Azure Virtual Network of your choice. By using Windows Admin Center to create the connection, this also creates the VPN Gateway Subnet and Certificate options. This eases the pain of creating connections between on-premises environments and Microsoft Azure public cloud infrastructure.
