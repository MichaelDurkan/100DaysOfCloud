## Introduction

In this post, I looked at how Terraform State stores information and acts as a database of the resources deployed in Azure. I also looked at Interpolation and how this is used to reference different parts of the Terraform configuration and the dependencies needed to deploy parts of our infrastructure (such as deploying a subnet into a vnet).
