I wanted to break Azure Virtual Networks into 2 posts - this one looked at intra-vnet communication across different subnets and how we can use NSGs to control even that access

## Process

I deployed 2 VMs and ran through the process of communicating between subnets and also breaking that communication using an NSG rule
