# Azure Bastion

## Introduction

Azure Bastion is a PaaS VM that you provision inside your virtual network, providing secure and seamless RDP or SSH connectivity to your IAAS VMs directly from the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines do not need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.
