# Linux Cloud Engineer Bootcamp - Week 4

## Introduction

Week 4 was all about Containers, and Mike gave us a run through of Docker and the commands we would use to download, run and build our own Docker Images. We then looked at how this works on Azure and how we would spin up Docker Containers in Azure. The Lab exercises include exercises for doing this, and also for running containers in AWS.
